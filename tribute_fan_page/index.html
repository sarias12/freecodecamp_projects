            <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Arctic Monkeys' life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>2002–2005: Early years and record deal</h3>
                    <p>The Arctic Monkeys were formed in mid-2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy Nicholson. Turner and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in secondary school. Turner, who had grown up in a musical household as his father was a music teacher, played guitar in the then-instrumental only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and a new band member, Jamie Cook as a second guitarist.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>2006: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</h3>
                    <p>he band finished recording their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies in the first week.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>2007: Favourite Worst Nightmare</h3>
                    <p>The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single "Brianstorm". Like its predecessor, Favourite Worst Nightmare also quickly reached No. 1 in the album charts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2008–2010: Humbug</h3>
                    <p>After a brief hiatus during which Alex Turner toured and recorded with his side project the Last Shadow Puppets, the band recorded a total of 24 songs; 12 in the Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and 12 in the New York sessions with James Ford in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>2011–2012: Suck It and See</h3>
                    <p>NME reported in May 2011 that the band were teaming up with producer James Ford once again, and would be releasing their fourth studio album in late spring at the earliest. Q magazine reported that the fourth Arctic Monkeys album would be of a "more accessible vintage" than Humbug. Q printed edition 299 states "It's the sound of a band drawing back the curtains and letting the sunshine in".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2013–2016: AM and hiatus</h3>
                    <p>On 26 February 2012, the band released a new song titled "R U Mine?" on their YouTube channel. On 4 March, it went to No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart on downloads alone. On 21 April, the song was released as a single, with the track "Electricity" as a B-side, released additionally for Record Store Day. The song marked a direct shift in musical direction in comparison to their previous album, Suck It and See, by incorporating a heavy use of falsetto and hip hop beats, and eventually became the inspiration for AM.</p>
